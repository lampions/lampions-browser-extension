# Mailgun-Chrome

This is a small Chrome extension to define email forwards via Mailgun.com.

## Installation

The extension is currently **not** available in the Chrome Web Store, and
therefore has to be installed manually. To install it in Chrome, go to
`chrome://extensions`, make sure the `Developer mode` box is checked, and use
the `Load unpacked extension...` button to install the extension.
